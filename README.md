CController.java
</b><br>
The brain of the Calculator

<p><b>
CGFXModel.java
</b><br>
Graphics model that read all button icons into an array.
Also read the normal- and the advanced backgrounds.
The model also prepare the images as Icons so that the Viewer easily can present them.

<p><b>
CViewer.java
</b><br>
Viewer for the calculator. Has the action listeners and action handlers today, but the handlers will be moved to the Controller later.

<p><b>
Icn.java
</b><br>
Enumeration for matching buttons with array.index

<p><b>
IconMAP.java
</b><br>
Wasn't sure if enumeration would cut it and as it did my map is really obsolete and should be removed.
